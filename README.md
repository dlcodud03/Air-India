# The Return of Air India?
Air-India Project

This repository contains the analysis and findings for the Air India Project. The primary goal of this project was to analyze customer sentiment and word frequencies related to Air India before and after its acquisition by Tata. This analysis aims to evaluate the success of Air India’s takeover using various technical and analytical methods.

Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

1. Scraper_Skytrax_Project.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook containing the web scraping code used to collect customer reviews and feedback from Skytrax. This notebook covers data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing of textual data.
2. Time-series Analysis.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook focusing on the time series analysis of sentiment data to identify trends and changes over time. The analysis compares the pre- and post-takeover periods to assess the impact of Tata’s acquisition.
3. Slides_Project.pptx - A presentation summarizing the project findings, including key insights, visualizations, and conclusions. This slide deck is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project.
4. Air India Project PPT.pdf - A PDF version of the project presentation for easy sharing and review.
5.Data Files:
	•	2022to_present_wordfreq.csv: Contains word frequency data from 2022 to the present period.
	•	attribute_word_frequencies(present).csv: A dataset of word frequencies categorized by specific attributes for the present period.
	•	attribute_word_frequencies.csv: A dataset containing attribute-specific word frequencies.
	•	sentiment_data_v2.csv: A dataset with sentiment scores for customer reviews.
	•	top_100_word_frequencies_before_2022.csv: Contains word frequency data from before 2022.
